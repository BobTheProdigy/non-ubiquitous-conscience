Java Final Project -- Mastermind
This is my final project for Java. It utilized the following:
1. OOP Principles
   a. main class controlled game flow
   b. board class handled game's state and a row of rows
   c. row represented a set of pegs
   d. peg represented a single peg
2. Arraylists - dynamic data structures & list operations
3. Class constructors - default and custom constructor depending on user conditional
4. String manipulation - ANSI escape codes, split(), strip(), equals()
5. Control flow and loops - controlling max of 10 turns, error handling for user input validation loops, including some snarky comments for the user in Board class
6. Array and ArrayList Comparison - Row class comparison logic (checking hits and partials), Boolean Arrays (tracking which pegs have already been matched as hits or partials)
7. Modular Design and Methods - method abstraction, separation of concerns
8. Inheritance and Polymorphism - Override method for toString()
